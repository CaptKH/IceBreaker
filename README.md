# IceBreaker
My first attempt at a game physics and graphics engine.  All pointers and criticisms appreciated.

# Current Issues
- Objects don't scale when moving camera along z-axis, even with perspective projection
- Strange clipping
- Free roaming camera started, but working incorrectly -> still focued on central point
